# Metlab Supermarket Inventory Management System
# Requirements file for Python dependencies
# 
# This project uses primarily standard Python libraries.
# No external packages are required for basic functionality.
#
# Note: tkinter is included with most Python installations by default.
# If tkinter is not available, install it based on your operating system:
#
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# macOS: Usually included with Python from python.org
# Windows: Usually included with Python installer

# Optional: For enhanced security in production environments
# cryptography>=3.4.8  # Alternative to hashlib for more advanced encryption
# bcrypt>=3.2.0       # Alternative password hashing (more secure than SHA-256)

# Development and testing dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=6.2.0       # For unit testing
# pytest-cov>=2.12.0  # For test coverage
# black>=21.0.0        # For code formatting
# flake8>=3.9.0        # For linting

# Database tools (optional)
# sqlite3-utils>=3.30.0  # For advanced SQLite operations

# GUI enhancements (optional)
# pillow>=8.0.0       # For image handling in GUI
# customtkinter>=5.0.0  # For modern GUI themes (alternative to tkinter)

# Note: The core application runs with only Python standard library:
# - sqlite3 (database)
# - hashlib (password hashing)
# - getpass (secure password input)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - tkinter (GUI interface)
# - tkinter.ttk (themed GUI widgets)
# - tkinter.messagebox (GUI dialogs)
# - tkinter.simpledialog (GUI input dialogs)

# Minimum Python version required: 3.7+
# Recommended Python version: 3.8+ for best compatibility
